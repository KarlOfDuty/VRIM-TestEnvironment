Virtual Reality Interaction Model Test Environment
----
The environment I use in my Bachelor's Thesis "A comparison of interaction models in Virtual Reality using the HTC Vive"

### Technical specifications

The application is created in the game engine Unity, version `2017.3.1f1`, and all scripts are written in the C# programming language. The Virtual Reality headset support is provided through the SteamVR API, specifically using the `SteamVR plugin for Unity v1.2.3`. This plugin provides motion tracking and rendering for the Vive without the programmer needing to do much more than drag the included objects into their Unity project.

**Experiment system specifications:**

__CPU__: Intel® Core™ i7-6700K

__RAM__: 16GB DDR4

__GPU__: Nvidia GeForce GTX 980

__Storage__: Corsair Force LS SSD

### Setup

Clone the repo and open the unity project included within. You will probably have to upgrade it to whichever version you are using which may cause some issues that need to be resolved. It should work as is with version 2017.3.1f1.

To run it you will need SteamVR installed and a VR headset. The only headset tested is the HTC Vive, others may not work.
